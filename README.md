# VR-dealers-room
 Virtual reality dealers room template.  Orginally used for Anthrocon

 ## What is this?

 These are the source files for the dealer's room used for the VR DR at anthrocon.  This was the basis for the VR DR on VRchat and you can upload your own copy in about 10 minutes with this project.

 ## How to import to VRchat
Super easy!  Just click the download button on the top right, and download this github as a .zip folder.  Unzip it with the rest of your unity projects and add it to unity hub.  Open it with unity 2018.4.20.  You'll need to import the VRchat SDK, 2.0 or 3.0 will work just fine.  

Customize it how you'd like, and use the SDK to upload it to VRchat.  

There is also a .unitypackage in this repo.  That conatins the model and all the assets if you want to add it to your own boilerplate world template.  

## Usage
Feel free to modify, change, and share this world however you'd like!  Make a new dealers room, turn it into a furry hangout zone, build that laser tag in Hall B like you always wanted.  This world pairs well with the Virtual reality dealer's booth https://github.com/FirrSkunk/VR-Con-Booth  

If you make something, please share it back, I'd love to see what you make with it!  This project is licesned under the MIT license, which means you can do what you would like with it, but a link back to this project or an in world credit would be appericiated!
